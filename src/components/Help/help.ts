/**
 * This module replicates the global reactive state previously defined in Vue's help.js.
 * In Vue, it was defined as:
 *   export const showHelpModal = ref(false)
 *   export const minimize = ref(false)
 * 
 * In React, component state is managed locally via hooks.
 * These exports serve as placeholders for documentation purposes.
